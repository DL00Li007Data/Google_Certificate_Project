Introduction**\n\nThe data comes from Bellabeat, a hight-tech manufacturer focused on women's health products. The data comes form the application of Bellabeat products, and the data source link is like this: see [https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit]. \nThe App, Leaf and Spring's products contains relevant information about product users, such as Id, date, activity, sleep, stress, usage time, etc. As a data analyst, my goal is to develop product marketing strategies and high-level recommendations based on Bellabeat data.\n\n\n\n## **2. Business Tasks**\n\n\n\n### ** Step1: Ask- Understand the Problem. **\n\n    1) What are the treads in the use of smart devices?\n    \n    2) How do these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?\n    \n    3) How do these trends affect Bellabeat's marketing strategy?\n    \n\n\n### ** Step2: Prepare- What do I need **\n\n    1) Install related R packages\n    \n    2) Obtain data sets through FitBit Fitness Tracker Data and import them into RStudio respectively.\n    \n    3) In R, new data suitable for conditions could be obtained by merging, filtering, and extracting data sets.\n    \n    4) Split the original data through Google Sheet filtering, extracting important parameters, filtering, and other operations to obtain a new data set.\n    \n    5) Through SQL syntax in R, merge, filtering, and extracting to obtain new data sets that meet the conditions.\n    \n\n\n### ** Step3: Process- Make it Usable **\n\nI was using proper tools to find incorrect and incomplete data. Removing inconsistencies in data set, sometimes there might be duplicated entries.\n\nOne of the most important aspects to keep in mind - identifying whether your data is biased.\nEssentially, biased data will not be representative of the population or phonomenon of study, the issue we are trying to solve.\n\n\n\n### ** Step4: Analyze- Tell the Stackholders the Story **\n\n\n\n#### **A-part: Comprehensive Data Analysis**\n\nThe total number of users of Bellabeat's data is 33 users, and I calculated the number and percentage of the 33 users using the User's categories, which contains five types of users(Activity, Intensities, Sleeps, Steps, Weight), and a column chart used to disinguish different types of color visually. The conclusion shows that Activity, Intensities, and Sleeps users account was 100% percentage. And Steps users account for 72.73%. And Weight account for 24.24%. \n   \nTherefore, the utilization rate of the five product functions is very different. The hightest and the lowest utilization rate is 75% more. So, Bellabeat could refer to the last recommendation part to adjust the sales strategy.\n\n\n##### **  -- About TotalMinutesAsleep vs Activity_levels vs TotalSteps analysis**\n    \n    1) The total number of unique users is 131. We could intuitively detect which category has the most users from this combination result.\n    \n    2) Divide TotalSteps into five categories: \"Sedentary\", \"Low_Activities\", \"Medium_Activities\", \"Activities\", \"High_Activities\". \n    \n    Then, I divided TotalMinutesAsleep into three categories:\"Low_Sleep\", \"Reasonalble_Sleep\", \"More_Sleep\". Also, I divided the date into Monday to Sunday.\n    \n    3) Display the above data through four sets of visualization diagrams, respectively.\n\n\n##### **  -- Plot of TotalMinutesAsleep vs Activity_levels 1&2**\n    \n    I got Sedentary with the longest sleep time in Activity_levels, and Acitvities with the shortest sleep time. The user sleep time interval distribution of Sendentary Acitivity is smoother, and the sleep time span is wider. The user peak of Activities is steeper, and the interval of sleep time is narrower.\n\n\n##### **  -- BoxPlot of ActivityLevels_vs_TotalMinutesAsleep**\n    \n    By extracting 200 seeds, the boxplot shows that the average sleep time of Sendentary Activity users is longer, and the leaset sleep time is Activities users.\n\n\n##### **  -- Plot of Activity_Sleep vs Calories vs Day**\n    \n    The figure displayed that the consumption of Calories on Thursday is the largest and has the largest span, and the consumption of Calories on Monday and Tuesday is the least. Sunday's sleeping area is the largest.\n\n\n##### **  -- Plot of TotalSteps_vs_WeekDay**\n    \n    According to the figure, which displayed that the total number of steps on Saturday is the highest in the week, the peak is also the hightest, and the fluctuation is very large. The peak on Sunday was the lowest. From the graph, we could see that the curve of the total number of steps in the first three days of the week fluctuates the same, and the peak value is almost the same, and the fluctuations have become larger and larger since Thursday.\n    \n\n\n#### **B-part:Daily Analysis**\n\n\n\n * 1) Get important parameter values, including max_date, min_date, different_days, max_users, max_TotalSteps, min_TotalSteps, Average_steps_Daily.\n\n\n * 2) Obtain the required data set through SQL, and calculate the statistical correlation of related parameters.\n \n \n##### **  -- Correlation for TotalSteps vs TotalMinutesAsleep vs Calories**\n    \n    According to the statistical correlation, the visual map was obtained, and the correlation between TotalSteps and Calories was obtained, which proved that the records of Steps and Calories were consistent. But But TotalSteps vs TotalMinutesAsleep and Calories vs TotalMinutesAsleep were both negatively correlated, proving that two sets of data have opposite trends.\n\n\n##### **  -- Plot for Steps_level Daily Through one Month**\n \n     Through this visualization, you can get daily data for one month between 04/12/16 - 05/12/16. Regarding users with more than average steps and less than average steps, the total number of daily users is 33. \n     \n     Therefore, it displayed more users with a total of 9 days whose value is lower than the average number of steps, and more users with more than average number of steps on other days.\n\n\n##### **  -- Plot of WeekDays vs TotalMinutesAsleep vs TotalSteps**\n \n     This graph provides a more direct view of the overall trend of sleep minutes and steps per day of the week. We could see that only Sunday's trend is parallel or even upward. The rest of the time is downtrend, and the trend on Saturday and Monday has a more negative slope.\n  \n\n#### **C-part:Hourly Analysis**\n\n\n\n *  Get important parameter values, including max_Calories_hourly, min_Calories_hourly, max_TotalIntensity_hourly, min_TotalIntensity_hourly, max_TotalSteps_hourly, min_TotalSteps_hourly, different_days. \n\n\n##### **  -- Plot of Hours_of_Calories**\n\n    It could be displayed from the graph that Calories is the hightes during 14:00-18:00, and it is also the most concentrated during this period. It may be the time when everyone is working and going out every day, so the value of Calories is the hightest. The lowest Calories values exist daily between 02:00AM-04:00AM, and 12:00 noon, probably this is when people sleep and rest daily, so there won't be many exercises.\n\n\n##### **  -- Plot of Hours_of_TotalIntensity**\n\n     The graph show that except noon, the value of Intensity is very high from 8:00-19:00 daily, probably because this is the working time, so there will be pressure.\n\n\n##### **  -- **Plot of hours_of_steptotal**\n  \n     According to this plot which illustrated from the graph, Steps has an upward trend from 6:00-9:00, 11:00:19:00, probably because this is the pace of working hours, and it is proof of people's hard work.\n    \n\n\n### ** Step5: Share-Get Different Views. **\n\n     At this point, I will be making a perfect PowerPoint to tell my story to the stakeholders, but we need to know that everyone is baised. So I should get more different opinions in this step, the feedback voice of stackholders is not only criticism, but also new views and new requirements about this report, so I should seize the opportunity to communicate with stakeholders, to gather more useful information.\n\n\n\n### ** Step6: Ask- Understand the Problem. **\n\n    At this step, I will give the results and recommendations depending on my analysis, and I will provide the further actions which we could made. So, the decision-makers with my advices base on the analysis so they could make some data-driven decisions.\n    I put the specific recommendation at the bottom part.\n\n\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## **3.About the specific operation of step 4-Analyze**\n\n\n\n### **A.1 Installing Packages**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"library(data.table) # Import big files (CSV or Text) \ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(readxl)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-02-23T01:02:31.570080Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-02-23T01:02:31.572505Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-02-23T01:02:50.189009Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Loading and Installing Packages\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggpubr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(skimr)\nlibrary(wesanderson)\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(RSQLite)\nlibrary(sqldf)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(ggridges)\nlibrary(RColorBrewer)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-02-23T01:02:50.192871Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-02-23T01:02:50.242466Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-02-23T01:02:51.157669Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## **A.2 Import data from csv files**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"daily_activity <- read_csv(\"../input/fitbit/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/dailyActivity_merged.csv\")\ndaily_Calories <- read_csv(\"../input/fitbit/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/dailyCalories_merged.csv\")\nweight_log <- read_csv(\"../input/fitbit/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/weightLogInfo_merged.csv\")\nsleep_Day <- read_csv(\"../input/fitbit/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/sleepDay_merged.csv\")\ndaily_Steps<- read_csv(\"../input/fitbit/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/dailySteps_merged.csv\")\ndaily_Intensities<- read_csv(\"../input/fitbit/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/dailyIntensities_merged.csv\")\nhourlyCalories <- read_csv(\"../input/fitbit/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/hourlyCalories_merged.csv\")\nhourlyIntensities_merged <- read_csv(\"../input/fitbit/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/hourlyIntensities_merged.csv\")\nhourlySteps_merged <- read_csv(\"../input/fitbit/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/hourlySteps_merged.csv\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-02-23T01:02:51.161139Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-02-23T01:02:51.163712Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-02-23T01:02:52.544292Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":3,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### **A.3 Assign Id/ User_category**\nFor the following data sets, I would merge these data sets together by the same parameters.

So the sample size is small, so there is sample bias. Therefore, the validity of this data may no longer be informative. So I recommend Bellabeat could provid an up-to-date set of data to ensure data reliablity. If more realistic analysis results are required, we need more sample data. In conclusion, this analysis report only represents the analysis results of 33 small samples.\n\n\n* 2) Through comprehensive data analysis, the functions of Activity, Intensities, and Sleeps users cover more comprehensively 100%. Followed by the Steps function, accounting for 72.73%. The leaset used function is Weight users, which only accounts for 24.24%.\n\n  The data suggest that Bellabeat could focus more on the promotion and function development of Activity, Intensities, and Sleeps because these three functions are customers' favourite.\n   \n   The Weight function is the least popular, which is the low usage maybe due to the protection of personal privacy by customers, or because Weight is an item that cannot be encouraged in a short time for women, so I suggest that Bellabeat could change its thinking and display the results of Weight switch to a form of encouragement or motivation, such as getting a cut emoji or background image on Bellabeat's customer App, due to the customer losing weight from the previous day.\n   \n   The usage of the Sleep function is in the middle. This may be because not all users are willing to carry accessories such as watches and bracelets when sleeping. After all, they will affect the quality of sleep. Therefore, I recommend that Bellabeat company use more comfortable product materials, which could allow more users to use it while sleeping.\n   \n   \n* 3) Through the analysis of ActivityLevels, TotalMinutesAsleep, Calories, and WeekDay, people who exercise a little bit sleep longer and sleep the longest on Saturday. Sleep time during the workday is relatively short. Calories are consumed the most on Thursday and the least on Monday and Tuesday.\n\n    According to the data, I suggest that Bellabeat could add sleep reminder functions, such as recommending users not to stay up late, reminding the sleep time of the day in advance, etc., so that customers could maintain regular work and rest habits. Also, customers could remind to increase exercise appropriately on Monday and Tuesday to increase the consumption of Calories. Therefore, the addition reminder function could keep customers healthy.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
